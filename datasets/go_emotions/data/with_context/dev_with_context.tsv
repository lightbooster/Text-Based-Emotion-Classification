Lmaoo a team full of [NAME] blunders, sometimes I feel like it’s sabotage from the man above 	1	eew1654	i wish i was on your teams, i usually get a widow, an ashe, a horible ana, a honzo and a mcree and none of them can seem to find the point.
it was audrey! I painted this painting 10 years ago. today I took it off my sisters wall and decided to give her a make over	27	edggcz9	the eyes remind me of audrey hepburn. also this painting is sick

Honestly I thought it just meant any game where you couldn't choose Casual mode... which is everything pre-Awakening.	27	ef3mkos	the elitist meme used to be limited to just kaga's games, but what with heroes and fates, it seems that just about anything pre-awakening counts.
I feel the same way. I wasn't depressed when we lost.	27	edrqyar	yea, but during those times we did not have much hope. having hope and getting to the playoffs  years in a row and not being able to deliver hurts.

No, because it lets you search multiple modes at once.	27	edji1uh	would not rocket league's system kill off smaller queued modes? people see less people queueing for a mode, so they do not queue for it, then the mode dies.

Only £44m? Not enough.	10	eemqpdd	
U/scottgal - thank you! Coming from southern US, wanted to make sure!	15	eet8uj8	yes, pretty much all of them nowadays (outside of small village shops). fine to ask; many have signs on the door too. oh and yes both... 
Someone did. The person who impregnated them. Humans don't reproduce asexually, you can't just make yourself pregnant	27	ef7dcod	nobody made you carry the baby, you got pregnant yourself.

A thousand times this! I just found some of my old childhood stuff from the 80s with a 2 bar and it is fucking awesome.	1,17	eewao3i	full agree. i also would not mind a retro-classic feel for  and go to the two bar helmet logo with updated colors. 
Anytime I've taken benzo beforecoke, it completely negates any coke feeling	3,27	ee75eyj	i mix coke and benzos all the time mate. only real way, iv found, is to take a good / week off benzos, then a mg diaz will whack you again
Figured since [NAME] is expiring and you guys are tanking it didn’t really matter	3,27	ee99dvo	fuck no! not trading ag, dj and ross for barnes, dragic and dsj.... we do not need two point guards, ag is way better than barnes and ross is our best scorer off the bench.
Right? I’ve never heard of it being made with French dressing.	26	edllq1v	
I think he is dead but he died long before the supposed raid. He was old and sick, dying of kidney failure.	16	eexx4c7	if obl was not dead he would have released more videos to humiliate the us.

Reminds me of when we used to have an RB named [NAME] while [NAME] was at Texas	17,22	ef4el3x	when coaching becomes too troublesome so you start playing rb instead to mow down these kids.

You’re not being clear in what you’re trying to say. I’m unsure how to try to help you in this case.	5,6	edp5v32	what this means is that i need a jail cell.for treatment it is not something that is done 
Definitely not overreacting. Leave.	27	ee2lp3m

In both points and fouls Edit: [NAME], looks like he didn't pick up that foul. Good news!	0	edwkwli	 minutes in, jack salt is tied with clemson 
Also the infection that almost killed her because they tried to save the leg, leading her to get the prosthesis. 	27	eebj4hc	you mean her magical prosthetics that she had?
You are totally right. What I meant was:	4	ee6fojd	sh that is not what the snowflakes want to hear just nod and appease your soyboy bretheren. 
Jeez i need to find some of these places around me..would love a $2 beer. Everywhere i go is like $9 for draft help	18	edm14yj	
Given [NAME] was in charge of the transition I don't see how he kept his hands clean. I think if [NAME] goes down so does he.	27	edboeho	
It's still not something I'd jump to and I'm currently in a closed relationship really.	27	edkf8f5	yhea but there are not so many reasons for condoms lying around, especially if you normally do not use them.
It’s always entertaining watching people in the background semi-dance, while being painfully aware that they’re on camera	17	efhau83	
The myth is about selling shirts. Signing [NAME] opens up much more money making opportunities like commercials.	20	ed3behi	that is a myth and will not actually be the case
My bad on the terminology, see my response above for some of my thoughts / concerns related to the presence of 2-chlorophenol	27	ee0wn5o	
leg-lock speaks to me in the most animalistic level	27	eettwqd	not bad, but you cannot beat: dark skin, tomboy, childhood friend, holding hands, leg-lock, impregnation.
Armenian elves are known for their thick skin and mouth-breathing. This one seems stoned, I’d stay away from it.	27	ee4exc5	
Personally I'm wondering why our OP didn't go with the clone angle. That's way more insane than them just being sent to prison.	26	ee7hqvo

Aw you seem upset, you are obsessed with talking shit about me. This move is indefensible.	2	edphk4s	probably forever. porzingis refuses to listen to logic so that he can continue spam this subreddit with random ass tweets from nobodies just because they mirror his opinion.

Thanks!!	15	eesh7lb	
It's riskier to take on bad contracts right now	19	eeaqrj7	eh he could increase his trade value but he could also tank it if he continues to not improve. it is a risky situation to keep him.

I love that both replies to you are correct. It can be hard to tell cars apart.

Barely as in just this year	27	ed4wdxp	winning your division by  games by going  is barely making the playoffs? 
I'm definitely feeling like it's been a never ending hurting fest, so I hope you're right.	20	ed7jht2	this is true and just finding that one will seem like a never ending hurting fest but he will come out of the woods. 
I agree w that.	4	eeumfk9	the timing of the firing is wrong though. he finally had a fully healthy roster (not counting denzel) and garpax barely gave him a chance to prove himself.
