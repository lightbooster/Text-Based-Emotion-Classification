Lol.... i guess your personal experience explains everything.... personally I've seen this play out numerous times in the work place..... so.....	1,22	eesyhd2	"ah, so i guess my job with coworkers who i appreciate and value must be a figment of my imagination after all, anything that does not fit socialist dogma is ""not real"", right?"
Super unflattering. [NAME] is not overweight but this ensemble made her appear chunky.	10	ee52iny	her outfit is so stupid. 
Wow that's a really great explanation. Makes sense!	0	ef9ibsj	
Your manager sounds like an idiot. Not saying he/she is. Just sounds like it from this.	2	edm9lwz

That's the worst feeling haha	1	edtkad3	
No. It‚Äôs slower and takes more calculation but it can be done. That‚Äôs why it should be practiced.	10	edljwii	is not that really difficult with the holsters that are meant to prevent others people from pulling your gun out during a struggle?
Please dont put words into my mouth.I never said rape isnt a problem.	3	efa80q4	yeah i see that being a major problem. not like rape, which is almost nonexistent!

Fortunately, finding yourself and deepening your spiritual connection with the world only takes about 4 days in a beach hut with a thatched roof.	27	ed5hvpa	um no, sorry. she was there to find herself. she was on a spirit journey of the soul. she just wanted to do yoga on top of a mountain, that is all.
they do poorly making me feel otherwise	27	edxbkzt	it does not. the fact that you think it does says a lot.
 Now, can you make another applet to change his wallpaper?	27	eer0hlf	
I did and found it basically the same except I was getting drunk very easily.	4	eeuer5u	
Weird, though. So many people love to identify themselves by their corporate loyalty.	27	eepf1aq	usually people with the same car that has a culture/following. jeeps, pretty much all motorcycles, muscle cars, classic cars... expect to get waived at by people in similar cars. very, very common thing.
Thanks, I love it.	15,18	edgkwiy	interesting analysis. here is your [payment]( 
Ok, thats my thinking too. If [NAME] really only gets 180 anyone who didn't make that deal (like us) is pretty dang foolish.	3,9	eevggs1

"You can't post a Sons pic and then say ""I got this"", that just hurts."	10,25	ee9ly91	"after that first one hit the post and everyone went for a change, you could literally see him be like ""fuck it, i got this""..."

Yeah this is pretty eye opening. I‚Äôve had pretty weird relationships with my reflection in the past but thankfully it‚Äôs not always this way.	15	ef49up7	i did not know that was a bpd thing. i thought my face was just weird.

[NAME] doesn‚Äôt roll his ankle on a üéæ in 2011 and we win a premiership imo	27	ef6ij1d	even weirder way to spell todd payt*e*n.
True. Icing all three of your villains for the duration of the film is a bad idea. They need to be making moves.	27	ef4yaoq	 the slow speed chase would have still sucked even if they had plugged all the plotholes.

Sweaty little incel virgin	27	ee6o1mk	ya diet totally has nothing to do with it. 
Gotcha. I was married a few years before that, but you might have known my sister. She dated a guy in your branch named [NAME]	27	ed9q88b	perhaps we met at a combined activity during the time you mentioned. i was in the black mountain branch before they dissolved it and put us in with the mt. woodson ward in about .
Food must be good then. It looks good. Besides the wood plank lol	0,1	edojqsb	well they have been open around  months and the boards look like hell already. i hope they replace them soon, i want this cool new spot to succeed despite their initial dumb mistakes.
TAMAR ESPECIALLY!!!	27	ef0l1n5	
It would be a little less irritating if the 10 cents you pay if you want some paper bags didn't go to the government as a tax.	3,27	ee57n4o	i live in one if the early bag-free cities. it is really not a big deal. 
I'm a little sad that there's not actually a video called Dance of the Hillary, virus or not.	25	eeodqq2	
Loathing Big Pharma has nothing to do with being anti-vax.	10	eedegp1	but but but big pharma

Yard goats was awesome. Almost a major league feel to it when it‚Äôs a packed day	0	edpohoj	"i kept saying ""yeah i am going to get out to the yard goats... sometime"" but i am determined to get out to hfc and dunkin (donuts still?) park this summer."
He doesn't realize she's banging the ukulele guy.	27	ed2exc8	
[NAME] dumb friends wanted him with the little baddie. and now he's gonna end up back in jail. Oh [NAME] I love [NAME].	18	edrcdu7	
So people will support him in this fake news quick reaction political environment	27	efdl37e	why even report it?
> You don't own them so that they will give you eggs, you saved them and now coincidentally they give you eggs. This!	27	eed43l9	
Does that idiot not realize he's roasting himself by calling [NAME] a bad lawyer? You worked with him for a decade, moron.	3	eeuzpi9	
Put the dip in your butthole. Better buzz and no risk of losing your jaw	27	edr3vme

You beat me to it	3,27	eeyvhw6	they are all different because of the numbers, duhh 
I hope for Irelands sake you're right.	20	edton0g	
Can't you tell that [NAME] is a serious threat to apprehend. All that alleged lying makes him a serious threat to others.	10	eeznzou	perhaps the whole tac team assault rifles raid was more for the 'coincidental' cnn camera on site than it was to process the arrest of an accused person. for a non-violent crime its pretty loopy shit.
That‚Äôs an interesting take. Thank you for giving me some perspective, never saw it like that. 	7,15	edfkr3y	
I feel extremely bad for people in this thread who are in any way shape or form relying on the federal government to improve their situation.	9	ef18p9c

Your kind honestly need to fuck off out of Ireland. Nobody wants your dumb fucking antisemitism here	3	ef6dg2i	yeah imagine believing in the holohoax the irish government did not at the time and was very sympathetic towards the germans and a few irish even tried to bring fascism to ireland through the blue shirts.
Alllllllllmooooooooost got ittttttttt.	27	eezgiqe	
By all means, go for it. We'll all be much happier when you're not dragging us down anymore.	4	eeaq6n6	the level headed look for another team*

Crime in the park is the only kind of crime that matters for the sake of this discussion. Your generality does not apply here.	10	edoewx5	i am speaking for crime as a whole not just crime in the park. both are pretty important to consider 
Wife left me and I am just broken. relapsed tonight from 7 years clean and just not seeing a point anymore	25	ef94f03

Damn, we need healthy PGs.	3	ef55sqj	
Ik I‚Äôm crying rn	25	ee4utnt	sandra bullock really transformed her look to play seris. amazing.
Completely valid point but [NAME] is better than anyone [NAME] had to work with.	0	ed5khaq	they are not necessarily wrong. caldwell would probably be good for a young qb, but you would have to worry about tanking the run game, especially with a less than stellar old. 
FWIW this was also posted yesterday	22	ed20116	
[NAME] had them a few months ago. Friend bought some for her sick dog.	5	ef16i3p

I agree! I loved him as [NAME] and I wish the writing had been better. He's amazing.	0,18	eevqkpu	i love that actor in everything he is in. he was fantastic as hades in once upon a time. crappy storytelling, but great acting on his part. he really needs to be given his own show.

People say 'confidence is attractive' which is definitely true. That doesn't mean that being arrogant or pretending to be confident is attractive.	4	ef0jr91	"dude, throw me a freaking bone. literally everyone on these forums says ""b confidenz"". there is no other caveat to it either, they say confidence by itself is attractive and one of the most important traits.
