Doubt that. Skins for [NAME], [NAME] and [NAME] don't change the shape of their wings, so why should they for [NAME]?	6,7	ed5qov9	tfw the entire community forgets this is an fp game and blizzard intentionally left the base skin lacking so people will buy a better skin in the future.

They don't even have that anymore, since [NAME] up and left the party.	27	eesyt7m	 five times failed ukip candidate so the joint second-most-successful candidate ukip have fielded in scotland, then? (given that afaik they have only won one seat, ever, which is coburn's mep seat).

yeah I figured, that's actually incredibly annoying. that only flies because they don't care about bf4 anymore? time to start favoriting servers I guess	3	ef8tnkb	it is to lure more players on to the server.

There are far more bad ones than good ones. Stepparents that treat their stepchildren as their own are noteworthy for a reason.	27	ee4x7x2	i know there are a great many cases of stepparents being terrible, but it is really unfair on the good ones!
"""By far one of the best"" Mmmm"	4	eczusbt	
Also part of the idea is that it’s nothing special. It’s just our flag. You don’t have to order something different.	27	ef9ttoi	the whole region including the county has french heritage. the yellow and blue are a homage to that. removing the yellow just makes the flag look flat. 
It's perfectly fine	4	eed4tkd

That's a really cheap cop-out for rather common criticism of those games.	3	eeipi7y	it just sounds like you are not the target audience for this type of game then, the senseless killing and exploration and joking about it is all part of the game, if you do not like it why play it?
So can we all collectively accept that [NAME] has a high placement for this week? Okay thank you	15	edwe3w0	
So America and the USSR are the exact same thing to you? Sorry you're so small minded, hope you learn to grow in the future.	20,24	edxwbji	personally i do not give a shit about nuance when it comes to regimes that brutally suppress and murder their own populations. sorry.

Fair enough. I considered it malicious compliance because I followed the letter if the rules while purposely not following the spirit.	27	eehm1c1	nice story but i do not really see anything malicious, you seemed to enjoy writing it, the teacher recieved it well. everyone wins.
people have built such a stigma around it that it's what comes to mind first instead of positive thoughts.	27	ee103qd
